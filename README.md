1. Establish webpack and dev enviroments - setting up concurrently to launch localhost8080 (front end) and localhost3000(backend)


index.html > bundle > - index.js as entry >  app.js > components

server > API > client

2. Establish react elements onto the page in app.jsx - just get box to show
    title, button to submit

3. server - create post request - error handlers etc


Front end- fields, submit functionality
backend - api - get and post requests



Future Features:
